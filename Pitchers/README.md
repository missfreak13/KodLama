## 1. Introduction: The Critical Need for Early Sepsis Detection and the Role of AI

Sepsis represents a significant global health challenge and remains a primary cause of mortality and morbidity among hospitalized patients. This life-threatening condition arises from a dysregulated host response to infection, leading to organ dysfunction. The consequences of delayed recognition and treatment of sepsis are severe, with studies indicating a substantial increase in mortality and morbidity for each hour that passes before appropriate interventions are initiated.

Research has consistently demonstrated that a delay of even one hour in the administration of antibiotics can elevate the risk of death by a significant margin, often cited in the range of 4-9%. Furthermore, the progression to septic shock, a critical stage characterized by arterial hypotension, carries an exceptionally high mortality rate, approximating 40%.

Beyond the devastating clinical impact, the financial burden associated with sepsis management is substantial for healthcare systems worldwide. In the United States, sepsis has been identified as the most expensive condition requiring hospitalization, incurring billions of dollars in annual healthcare expenditure. The average cost associated with a single sepsis-related hospital admission far exceeds that of many other medical conditions.

Despite the gravity of this condition, current diagnostic methodologies, which include clinical assessments and laboratory tests, often fall short in providing the necessary speed and accuracy for timely intervention. These traditional approaches can be time-consuming, especially when reliant on laboratory results, and may struggle to differentiate sepsis from other inflammatory states presenting with similar clinical manifestations. Moreover, established sepsis scoring systems, such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, exhibit limitations in their sensitivity and specificity for early detection.

In response to these challenges, Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly through the application of machine learning (ML) techniques, presents a promising avenue for enhancing early sepsis detection. AI algorithms possess the capability to analyze extensive and complex healthcare datasets, potentially identifying subtle patterns and early indicators of sepsis that might escape the notice of human observers. This capacity for intricate data analysis holds the potential for enabling earlier and more accurate diagnoses, ultimately leading to more timely and effective interventions.

The primary objective of leveraging AI in this context is to improve patient outcomes by facilitating the prompt initiation of appropriate treatments, including antibiotics and supportive care. This Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on demonstrating the fundamental concept of real-time sepsis risk prediction through the continuous monitoring of critical vital signs.

## 2. Project Overview

This project develops an MVP for an AI-powered early sepsis detection system. It leverages machine learning to analyze real-time patient vital signs and predict the likelihood of sepsis development. This MVP aims to:
